This is the list of issues I found during compilation:

1. Java sources are not properly listed, compilation fails.

There is a file in <build_dir>/java/CMakeFiles/GvgAmpClientJava.dir called
java_sources. This file should list the files for javac to compile the java
class. Instead of the filenames separated by <cr>, this file contains just a
*.java line that javac cannot use and reports an error.

I modified the java/CMakeLists.txt and added a FILE(GLOB.... line and modified 
the add_jar line around line 28. This didn't solve the problem.

To compile the java before making the first cmake, uncomment line 30, after cmake failed,comment line 30 and uncomment 28, 29. This is fine unless the build directory is removed.
